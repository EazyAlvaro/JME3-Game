JME3-based 3d game project for hobbytainment
=======

immediate TODO:
* visual UI
* abstract the [expletive deleted] out of GameClient
* procedural texture/splatmapping for terrain
* Variable camera angles
* player body model (use stock golem for testing)
* night/day cycle lighting
* implement trees/grass (low priority, it's still not in RC branch )
